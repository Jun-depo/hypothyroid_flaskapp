# Hypothyroid prediction, a simple flask app. 

I built this flask app on a small machine learning project I did in the past. Based on previous work, I could get decent prediction with numeric testing data with Baysian approach (link). Neural network model with numeric data gave similar levels of performance. Although predictions would be better using all data, I just wanted a simple version of the app with less input.

The project is still in progress. I will add more html page stylings with css/bootstraps and authentication for the database access also.
